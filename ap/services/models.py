""" SERVICES models.py 
This data model defines services in the training. We organize services in the following way:
    Category: this is a broad category that contains specific services. For example,
    Cleanup is a category that contains services such as Tuesday Breakfast Cleanup or
    Saturday Lunch Cleanup. Guard contains Guards A, B, C, and D. 

    Service: this refers to a specific service that repeats on a weekly basis.
    I.e. Tuesday Breakfast Prep is a service. It repeats every week. A specific instance
    of that service is defined in the service scheduler module as a service Instance.

    Period: this is a period in which services are active and generally changes with
    the schedule of the training. Most of the time, the regular FTTA schedule will be in
    effect, but there are exceptions such as Service Week and the semiannual training.
