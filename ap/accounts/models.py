""" accounts models.py
The user accounts module takes care of user accounts and
utilizes/extends Django's auth system to handle user authentication.

USER ACCOUNTS
    Because we want to use the user's email address as the unique
    identifier, we have chosen to implement a custom User model, 

    ...

PROFILES
    User accounts are extended by Profiles, which contain additional information,
    generally representing roles that various users fill. The two most common
    ones, Trainee and TA, are implemented here. Other examples include:
        - every Trainee is also a service worker, so those user accounts also
        have a ServiceWorker profile that contains information needed for the
        ServiceScheduler algorithm
        - before coming to the FTTA, a trainee may have come to short-term. 
        These trainees will have a Short-Term profile at that time, and later
        also have a Trainee  profile when they come for the full-time.

    The usage of profiles allows user to have multiple roles at once, and also
    allows a clean transition between roles (e.g. a Short-termer who becomes a
    Trainee and then later a TA can keep the same account throughout).
